# Mobile Bluetooth Controlled Robot Car 🤖

This repository contains the code and documentation for a mobile Bluetooth-controlled robot car built using Arduino. The car can be remotely operated via a smartphone app, allowing users to control direction, speed, and other features wirelessly.

## Features

- **Bluetooth Control**: Operate the car from any distance within range of the Bluetooth signal.
- **Directional Controls**: Change the direction of the car using simple commands sent over Bluetooth.
- **Speed Adjustment**: Adjust the speed of the car to suit different terrains and driving conditions.
- **Stability Enhancements**: Includes features to improve stability during operation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
